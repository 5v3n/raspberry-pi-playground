# RaspberryPi GPIO demos

## blink

Bascially an even more basic version of @ladyada 's [LED E-Mail Notifier](https://gist.github.com/3062225). I'm using the [Adafruit Pi Cobbler Breakout Kit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/914) to connect an LED to pin 24. This code let's the led - drumroll - blink!

## more to come

Let's play around a little... feel free to contribute other basic examples!

## General Python hints

My python skills are weak, but it seems to me like:

Currently `pip` does not offer the version of [RPi.GPIO](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO) needed for revision 2 RaspberryPi boards. You can find the needed [0.4.0+ version here](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO#downloads).
